# SwiftUI Modifiers

OSLogKit offers readily available modifiers that greatly simplify the process of adopting OSLog.

### ðŸ§© CaptureLogOnAppear
* **logger** : log instance for which logs need to be captured
* **message** : string which needs to be logged
* **level** : specific level on which log needs to be captured
* **perform** : Since this modifier is made on top of OnAppear in order to perform additional actions in OnAppear you can use this param
```swift
func captureLogOnAppear(_ logger: OSLogKit, _ message: String, _ level: OSLogType = .default, _ perform: (() -> Void)? = nil)
```

### ðŸ§© CaptureBulkLogOnAppear
* **logger** : log instance for which logs need to be captured
* **message** : strings that need to be logged
* **level** : specific levels on which logs need to be captured
* **perform** : Since this modifier is made on top of OnAppear in order to perform additional actions in OnAppear you can use this param
```swift
func captureBulkLogOnAppear(_ logger: OSLogKit, _ messages: [String], _ levels: [OSLogType], _ perform: (() -> Void)? = nil)
```
