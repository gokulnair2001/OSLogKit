# ``OSLogKit``

A Layer 2 framework for OSLog which makes its adoption more easier⌨️

## Overview

OSLogKit is a layer 2 framework developed on top of the native OSLog system, aiming to simplify the integration of OSLog into your project. Apple has done an excellent job in ensuring that OSLogging is straightforward and easy to use. However, when it comes to implementing OSLog in your codebase, can be challenging.

To address this, OSLogKit has been developed, further simplifying the process of adopting OSLog. One notable advantage of OSLogKit is that it offers additional functionalities not available in the native API.

OSLogKit has a variety of Modifiers which makes OSLogKit adoption very easy. Don't worry if your code base is in UIKit, you can still adopt it quickly.
